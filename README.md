# Pup-a-mania!

Hi, and welcome to **Pup-a-mania!**

## Description

**Pup-a-mania** is an easy-to-use application that allows you to either search for, choose or randomly generate dog breed pictures. Not only that, but this application also provides the user with great pictures of the generated breed, the name of the breed (in case they take a liking to it), and the ability to view multiple photos of said breed!

There are alternatives and similar applications to mine, such as [dogtime](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/) or [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), but I believe my take on the idea encompasses every type of user. For example, **dogtime** simply generates a random breed. Nothing more, nothing less. **dog.ceo** is far more detailed in that it not only gives you information on the breed but allows you to search for any breed as well. My application not only does all of this, but I have made it far more user-friendly *and* expanded the utility in more ways. Finally, any and all would-be dog owners can browse dog breed pictures to get a feel of which one they fancy!

## Usage

Pup-a-mania can assist all three types of incomers, such as:

+ Those who **know** the breed they want to search for, 
+ Want to **choose** from a list of all breeds, or
+ Want to surprise themselves with a **random** breed!

The application is very user-friendly, but let's go over how to use it:

## Reset Button

After every and all breed generations, make sure to use the reset button. This will reset the application stage to make room for the next desired functionality.

## Choosing Your Breed

This application function allows you to go into the experience not knowing much about dog breeds. Let's do a quick walkthrough!: 

1. Click and choose the one you wanna see, hit enter and your cute pup appears!

## Roadmap

In the future, I will most definitely be adding some features. Here is the latest list of future releases.

- Application will also generate information on the breed
- Application will also generate tips and guidance on how to care for the generated breed
- Application will also include companies, non-profits, and animal shelters that have the breed for adoption
- Will add navigation bar that will scroll to the information on the generated information

More coming soon!..
