# Pup-o-mania!
Hi, and welcome to **Pup-o-mania!**

## Description
**Pup-o-mania** is an eay-to-use application that allows you to either search for, choose or randomly generate dog breeds. Not only that, but this application also provides the user with great pictures of the generated breed, the name if the breed (in case they take a liking to it) and the ability to view multiple photos of said breed!

There are alternatives and similar applications to mine, such as [dogtime](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/) or [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), but I believe my take on the idea encompasses every type of user. For example, **dogtime** simply generates a random breed. Nothing more, nothing less. **dog.ceo** is far more detailed in that it not only gives you information on the breed, but allows you to search for any breed as well. My application not only does all of this, but I have made it far more user friendly *and* expanded the utility in more ways. Finally, any and all would-be dog owners can browse dog breed pictures to get a feel of which one they fancy!

## Usage
Pup-o-mania is able to assist all three types of oncomers, such as:

+ Those who **know** the breed they want to search, 
+ Want to **choose** from a list of all breeds, or
+ Want to surpise themselves with a **random** breed!

The application is very user-friendly, but let's go over how to use it:

## Reset Button
After every and all breed generations make sure to use the reset button. This will reset the application stage to make room for the next desired functionality.

## Choosing Your Breed
This application function allows you to go into the experience not knowing much about dog breeds. Just: 

1. Click and choose the one you wanna see, hit enter and your cute pup appears!
